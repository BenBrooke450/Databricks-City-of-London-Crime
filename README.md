# Crime in the City of London

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c93255df-5b80-4766-936b-025ef786f677)

The first modern police force in the world was established in London in 1829 by Sir Robert Peel. This force, known as the Metropolitan Police Service, was created to address the growing need for organized law enforcement in the rapidly expanding city. The officers were often referred to as "Bobbies" or "Peelers" after Sir Robert Peel.

Before the establishment of the Metropolitan Police, law enforcement in Britain relied on local constables and night watchmen. For example, the Bow Street Runners, founded in 1749 by magistrate Henry Fielding, were an early form of organized policing in London
